Sources
=======

A **source** defines and configures the way a metric shall get measured.

It normally contains a set of parameters, which are shared between all metrics, which use this source.
But each metric can override specific parameters for its own measurement.

A metric must reference a ``source type`` defined in a ``.farm``-file.
And a ``source type`` needs to reference a ``source class``, which is provided by Metric-Farmer extensions and defined
as a function in a Python file.

**Context example**

Image you are working for a company. This company is using **Jira** for their issue systems.
Two different Jira installation exist: One for development tasks and one for product requirements.

The needed functions to access this Jira systems and measure metrics are the same, therefore only one ``source class``
is needed, which must be provided by an Metric-Farmer extension.

But both systems are available on different URLs and use different credentials.
So two ``source types`` are needed, to store the different urls and credentials as parameters.
These ``source types`` must be configured by the user in a ``.farm``-file.

The needed metrics can then measure the needed JIRA system by referencing the correct ``source type``.
The metrics itself are only setting a filter parameter to get the needed data.

Source types
------------

``Source types`` are referenced by metrics and add a use-case specific configuration to a normally
not configured ``source class``.

**Example**: Referenced source in a metric definition

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/farmer_files/simple/my_metrics.farm

Both metrics use the same source ``html_file_count``, but the last metric also overrides the ``path`` parameter.

**Example**: Referenced source class in a source definition

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/farmer_files/simple/my_sources.farm

This source references the source class ``mf.file_count``.
``mf`` is the namespace of the extension (here Metric-Farmer) and ``file_count`` is the source function to call.

.. _predefined_sources:

Predefined sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metric-Farmer provides the predefined sources ``static``, ``random`` and ``file_count``.
They are used mainly for examples and simple use cases.

This is the content of the ``.farm``-file, which defines the predefined sources:

.. literalinclude:: ../../metricfarmer/basics/sources.farm
   :language: json

**Usage example**:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/farmer_files/predefined/metrics.farm
   :language: json


.. _own_sources:

Own sources
~~~~~~~~~~~

Sources get defined in the ``sources`` section of a ``.farm``-file.

Example::

   {
      "metrics": {}
      "sources": {
         "my_source": {
            "class": "mf.file_count",
            "description": "Counts all c-files in all subfolders"
            "pattern": "**/*.c"
         }
      }
      "targets": {}
   }

They must have a ``class`` parameter, which must contain a string to reference a ``source class``
from a Metric-Farmer extension. Run ``metricfarmer --list`` to sell all available source classes.

They should also have a ``description`` parameter for documentation.

All other needed parameters are based on the selected ``source class``.
So please take a look into their documentation to find out which parameters are available and are mandatory.

Defined ``sources`` can be used and referenced in all other ``.farm``-files.

Source classes
--------------

A ``source class`` is the link to a python function, which does the specific measurement work.
They are provided by Metric-Farmer extensions.

For all available source classes on your installation, please execute ``metricfarmer --list``.

Predefined source classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metric-Farmer provides already some basic source classes to support some frequent use cases.

You can use them inside your own ``source type`` definitions

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   sources": {
      "my_source": {
         "class": "predefined_target_class",
         "a_parameter": 123
      }
   }

Each ``source class`` has its own set of needed parameters.
See their documentation for a detailed picture.


Available target classes are:

.. contents::
   :local:

mf.static
+++++++++

``mf.static`` allows to get static values from sources.

.. list-table:: Parameters

   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Parameter

.. _mf.random:

mf.random

``mf.random`` returns a random number as measurement result.

Use ``min`` and ``max`` parameters to define the range.

.. list-table:: Parameters

   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

.. _mf.file_count:

mf.file_count
+++++++++++++

``mf.file_count`` measure the amount of files inside a folder and its subfolders.

Use ``pattern`` to define what kind of files shall get measured.

.. list-table:: Parameters
   :widths: 20 50 20 10
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description

     - Required
   * - path
     - Path to a folder, where Metric-Farmer shall count the files
     - current working directory
     - No
   * - pattern
     - Unix style pattern, which defines what to count. See `docs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html>`_ for details.
     - ``**/*``
     - No

.. _mf.rest:

mf.rest
+++++++

``mf.rest`` allows to take a specific part of the answer of a
`REST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_  call as measurement result.

.. list-table:: Parameters
   :widths: 20 50 20 10
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
     - Default
     - Required
   * - url
     - Complete url for the request.
     - None
     - Yes
   * - user
     - Username to use for Basic Authentication, if needed.
     - None
     - No
   * - password
     - Password/Token to use for Basic Authentication, if needed.
     - None
     - No
   * - headers
     - List of headers, which needs to be set for the call.
     - {'content-type': 'application/json'}
     - No
   * - method
     - HTTP method type. Supported are GET, POST and PUT
     - GET
     - No
   * - payload
     - Structured data, which will be send as json data.
     - None
     - No
   * - result_call
     - Python statement, which gets evaluated and defines the location of the data, which shall be taken as measurement result
     - None
     - No

``result_call`` must be a Python based statement. This statement gets executed and has access to the request result
object under the name ``rest_result``.

Imagine the service sends back the following data::

   {
      "name": "Frank",
      "age": 32,
      "friends": ["Peter", "Alex", "Sandra"]
   }

If the ``age`` shall be taken as measurement result, the ``result_call`` must be ``rest_result['age']``.

But even more complex measurements are possible. Lets say we need to measure the amount of friends.
Then the ``result_call`` should be ``len(rest_result['friends']))``.

         }
      }
   }
